          <h4>
            History
          </h4>
          <p>
            First published in today's form by Ravensburger in February 1959.
            There are versions known from Japan in the 16th century - matching pictures painted on shells.
            Known as Awase or Kai-awase.
            In USA and England known as Pairs, Pelmanism, or Concentration.
            But these are played with simple playing cards.
            In Switzerland was a domino-like game named Zwillingsspiel with the same roots.
            In Czech Republic this type of game is known as Pexeso.
            It usually consists of 32 pairs of square cards.
            There are thousands of Pexeso sets with different themes.
          </p>
          <h4>
            How to play
          </h4>
          <p>
            Any deck of playing cards may be used, although there are also commercial sets of cards with images.
            The rules given here are for a standard deck of 52 cards, which are normally laid face down in four rows of
            13 cards each.
            The two jokers may be included for a total of six rows of nine cards each.
            Additional packs can be used for added interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standard rules need not be followed: the cards can be spread out anywhere, such as all around a room.
            In turn, each player chooses two cards and turns them face up.
            If they are of the same rank and color (e.g. six of hearts and six of diamonds, queen of clubs and queen of
            spades, or both jokers, if used) then that player wins the pair and plays again. If they are not of the same
            rank and color, they are turned face down again and play passes to the player on the left. Rules can be
            changed here too: it can be agreed before the game starts that matching pairs be any two cards of the same
            rank, a color-match being unnecessary, or that the match must be both rank and card suit.
            The game ends when the last pair has been picked up. The winner is the person with the most pairs. There may
            be a tie for first place.

              With many memory games based on spotting differences, or linking two related images.
              This will lead to an acceleration in distinguishing images from one and another.
